The storage acceptances logic also supports operations between variables, enabling you to combine multiple variables to construct advanced logic that can 
accommodate a wide range of requirements.

## Supported operations

- `Sum`
- `Substraction`
- `Multiplication`
- `Division`

{{< alert icon="warning" >}}
Each operation is limited to a maximum of 2 variables, but you can chain operations together to achieve the desired results. For example, you can create expressions like `VariableA + (VariableB + VariableC)`, which is equivalent to `VariableA + VariableB + VariableC`

{{< alert icon="tip" >}}
To perform operations like VariableA + VariableB - VariableC, you can incorporate both addition and subtraction within the same rule
