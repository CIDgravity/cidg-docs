Storage acceptances logic also accept operations between variables. They will allow you to combine several 
of them to create advanced logic that can meet all needs

## Supported operations

- `Sum`
- `Substraction`
- `Multiplication`
- `Division`

{{< alert icon="warning" >}}
All operations only support a maximum of 2 variables. On the other hand, the operations can be chained together to give something like VariableA + (VariableB + VariableC), which is equivalent to VariableA + VariableB + VariableC

{{< alert icon="tip" >}}
In the same way, if you want to do VariableA + VariableB - VariableC, you can add on the same rule, an addition and a subtraction
