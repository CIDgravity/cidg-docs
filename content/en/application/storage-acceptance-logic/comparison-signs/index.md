In the acceptance logics storages, you can perform different operations. You can then add comparison signs

It is all of these two elements that define an acceptance rule.

Within the storage acceptance logics, various operations can be executed, allowing for the incorporation of comparison operators.

These two constituents collectively constitute the foundation of an acceptance rule.

## Supported comparison signs

- `==`
- `<=`
- `>=`
- `>`
- `<`
- `!=`
- `Between`
- `Not between`
- `Is null`
- `Is not null`

With the utilization of these comparison operators, you have the capability to compare values, variables (e.g., VariableA < VariableB), or even operations (e.g., VariableA + VariableB !== VariableC)
