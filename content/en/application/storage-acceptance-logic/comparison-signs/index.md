In the acceptance logics storages, you can perform different operations. You can then add comparison signs

It is all of these two elements that define an acceptance rule.

## Supported comparison signs

- `==`
- `<=`
- `>=`
- `>`
- `<`
- `!=`
- `Between`
- `Not between`
- `Is null`
- `Is not null`

Using these comparison signs you can compare values, variables (VariableA < VariableB) or operations (VariableA + VariableB !== VariableC)
