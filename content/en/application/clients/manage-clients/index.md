You can navigate in the sidebar under `Clients`

![Manage clients using the client management page](clients-list.png)

On this page, you have an immediate and updated view of the miner's global limits (for storage and for retrieval)

For each customer in the list, different options are offered:

- **Edit**: edit all the informations related to a client
- **Delete**: remove a client
- **Block / release a client**: using this, you can reject all deals that came from this specific client by also specifying a personalized rejection message which will be sent to them
