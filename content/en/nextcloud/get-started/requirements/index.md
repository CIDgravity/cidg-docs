To begin using **CIDgravity** with **Nextcloud** and store your files on **IPFS/Filecoin**, make sure you meet the following requirements.

## Set up your own Nextcloud instance

{{< alert icon="info" >}}
This step is only necessary if you want to use your own Nextcloud instance as a relay. In this setup, your instance will connect to CIDgravity, and your personal tools will interact with your own instance. If you prefer to use CIDgravity directly, you can safely skip this step.
{{< /alert >}}

CIDgravity is designed to be added to your personal or organization-managed Nextcloud instance.

You can install Nextcloud using various methods:

* On a Linux server (manual or scripted)
* With Docker (ideal for quick testing)
* Via Snap, VM images, or cloud providers

## Understand what is a CID

A **CID**, or Content Identifier, is a cryptographic hash that uniquely represents a piece of content in decentralized storage systems like **IPFS** and **Filecoin**.

It acts as a permanent, tamper-proof fingerprint of the file, enabling secure retrieval from any peer on the network.

### Key Concepts

* **Content Addressing**
  A CID points directly to content, not a location. If a file exists on the network, it can be retrieved using its CID.

* **Immutability**
  Any change to the content changes the CID, guaranteeing integrity and preventing unnoticed tampering.

* **Use in IPFS & Filecoin**
  These networks rely on CIDs for storage and access. CIDgravity uses this system to store and reference your files.

## Important note

{{< alert icon="warning" >}}
Only files placed inside the `/Public Filecoin` directory are actually stored on **Filecoin** via CIDgravity.
Any files stored **outside** this directory will remain on **Twin Quasar's internal file servers** and **not** be replicated on the decentralized network.
