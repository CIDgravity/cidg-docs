## Managing multiple miners

A CIDgravity user can manage multiple miners, providing users with seamless switching between them.

To claim new miner, you can navigate to the `My Addresses` section located under your profile picture in the top navigation bar.

To initiate the claiming process for a new address, simply click on `Claim a new address`

Click here for more info in the [standard claiming process]({{< ref "storage-providers/get-started/claim-a-miner/index.md" >}})

Up to 10 miners can be amanaged by the same account. If you are looking to manage more miners. Reach out to us. 

## Manage user permissions

Multiple users can manage the same miner. Each user will have to claim the miner individually. Any option and setting are attached to a miner. Changes from one user will immediately apply.

All users accessing a miner have the same rights level.

### Remove access rights

User access rights can be removed by 
	- navigating to `My Addresses` section under your profile picture in the top navigation bar.
	- clicking on the key icon associated with the desired miner to review permissions.
